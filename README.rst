Course material for a course in OAuth2, JW*, OpenID Connect and UMA
===================================================================

Material we have used to give a course in a set of protocols
used for managing access.

This two day course will tell you all you need to know (and more) about
the next generation identity management and authorization protocols and
its constituent components. Part of the course is a more practical look
at relevant tools and libraries (in Python and/or Java).

After following this course you will:

* Know how OpenId Connect (OIDC) and User Managed Access (UMA) work and why.
* Know the basics of the building blocks for both OIDC and UMA:
- JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Signing (JWS) and JSON Web
Tokens (JWT), collectively referred to as JW*
- OAuth2, the open standard for Authorization
* Be able to work with the relevant OIDC tools/libraries for your own
development (environment)(*)

(*) Please note that the hands-on part assumes you are familiar with
development (environments) in general and that you 'bring your own
development environment'. Only Java and Python are covered.
